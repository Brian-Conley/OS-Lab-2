# Brian Conley - Smoker's Problem
## Overview
This program is a simulation of the smoker's problem. In this case, we solve it  
using semaphores. In this simulation we have:  
- Three agents (acting as one)  
- Three pushers (acting as one)  
- Six smokers  

## Build
Build the program by running the make command. The makefile provides other useful  
targets.  
- run: Run the program  
- clean: Remove build files
